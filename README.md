## Descriptions

Modified from GitHub user jooyoungseo [cv](https://github.com/jooyoungseo/jy_CV)

This repo has been created to systematically manage my academic CV. This is reproducible for those who have basic knowledge of R and R Markdown.

Based on [vitae package](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae/). The ecapabilities to include multiple bibliographic entries using [multiple-bibliographies lua filter](https://github.com/pandoc/lua-filters/blob/master/multiple-bibliographies/multiple-bibliographies.lua) that allow for printing of entries in [APA_CV style](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/blob/master/apa-cv.csl) where developed by [@jooyoungseo](https://jooyoungseo.github.io/jy_CV/JooYoung_Seo_CV.pdf).

Following this template, you would be able to print as many bib-entries as you want using your desired csl file and your `*.bib` files.
